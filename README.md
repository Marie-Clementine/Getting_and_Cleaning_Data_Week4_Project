# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Week4_Project

### This repository is a submission of the peer-graded assignment. 
### It contains all the explanations on how the project data was obtained and cleaned to get to the "FinalData" tidy set submitted.
### The final tidy data set title is: "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones".
### The submitted final tidy data set is a txt.file, "FinalData.txt".
### The submitted "run_analysis.R" script shows all the steps followed to get, prepare and clean the data. Five steps were followed:
###     step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
###     step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
###     step 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
###     step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
###     step 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
   
### This repository also contains a codebook, "CodeBook.md" describing all the variables of the data and how the data was cleaned.
